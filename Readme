# Voice Calculator Web App

A simple and interactive voice-enabled calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to perform calculations either manually or via voice input using the Web Speech API.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Input Support** (uses browser speech recognition)
- ✍️ **Manual Input Buttons** for numbers and operations
- 🧮 Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (power)
- 💾 **Calculation History**
- 🧹 **Clear Display** and **Clear History**
- 🧠 **Expression Evaluation** using JavaScript `eval()`
- 🪄 Smooth UI animations and hover effects

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: Web Speech API for voice recognition

## 🖥️ UI Overview

- `sub-display`: Shows the result
- `display`: Shows the current expression
- `history`: Shows the list of past calculations
- `buttons`: Grid of calculator buttons, including a voice button (🎙️)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `vcalculator_app.html` in your browser.
3. Allow microphone permissions when prompted.
4. Click the 🎙️ button and speak your math expression (e.g., "two plus two").

## 🗣️ Voice Command Examples

| Spoken Phrase         | Evaluated As     |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "five plus two"      | `5 + 2`          |
| "ten divided by two" | `10 / 2`         |
| "three into four"    | `3 * 4`          |
| "two power three"    | `2 ** 3`         |

> Voice inputs are automatically sanitized to map common math terms to JavaScript symbols.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Works best in **Chrome** or **Edge** (due to Web Speech API support).
- Uses `eval()` for expression evaluation – avoid entering untrusted inputs.
